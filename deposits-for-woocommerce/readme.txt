The WooCommerce Deposits and Partial Payments Plugin makes it easy for customers to buy products by paying a partial payment or a deposit upfront. With this powerful WooCommerce partial payment plugin, you can:

👉 pay a fixed deposit, or 
👉 choose a percentage-based upfront payment – helping you secure more sales effortlessly.

When shoppers have the option to use WooCommerce partial payments, they’re more likely to complete their purchases, even for higher-priced items.
